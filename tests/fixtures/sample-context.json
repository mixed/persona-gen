  "expanded": "Early adopters of autonomous vehicles comprise a diverse group of individuals who are among the first to embrace self-driving technology. They include tech enthusiasts who are drawn to cutting-edge innovation, professionals who see efficiency gains in automated commuting, individuals with mobility challenges who view autonomous vehicles as a path to greater independence, and environmentally conscious consumers attracted to the potential for reduced emissions.\n\nThese early adopters span various demographics but share common traits: higher than average comfort with technology, willingness to accept some uncertainty in exchange for being first movers, and sufficient financial resources to invest in emerging technology. They may be urban professionals, suburban families, or seniors seeking mobility solutions.\n\nTheir motivations range from practical (time savings, reduced driving stress) to aspirational (being seen as innovative, participating in technological revolution). Their concerns typically center on safety, reliability, legal liability, and the learning curve for new interfaces.",
